# CLTforExponentialDistribution

In this project we will investigate the central limit theorem via the exponential distribution, which can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda), where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda.
